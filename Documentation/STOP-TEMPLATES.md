# Stop Templates

Stop Templates allow you to improve data entry speed and efficiency for specific scenarios. They work best for repetitive situations that always have the same reason, actions and result. An example would be a traffic stop for speeding, or a seat belt violation.

To set up templates, they have to be uploaded to one of the blob storage accounts in a specific format.

Instructions about how to go about this can be found here: [Template Upload Instructions](./assets/Ripa%20Template%20Upload%20Instructions.pdf)

Sample templates are available here and can be modified to your agencies needs: [Sample Templates](./assets/SampleTemplates.csv)

The 2024 RIPA regulation amendments required specific testing with CA DoJ for which we published templates to make the testing easier. You can find information about those here:
