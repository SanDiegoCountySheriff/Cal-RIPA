# Cal-RIPA

## By CSSA & Insight Digital Innovation

The CSSA RIPA Azure Marketplace offering is a cost effective, turnkey option for close to 700 law enforcement agencies in the State of California to effectively and transparently comply with the California Racial and Identity Profiling Act of 2015 (RIPA).

RIPA requires all state and local law enforcement agencies to collect data regarding stops of individuals, including perceived demographic information on persons stopped, and to report this data to the California Attorney General's Office. Every agency in California must comply by January 1st 2022.

The CSSA RIPA application is a complete solution to comply with this mandate. Itâ€™s a Progressive Web App (PWA) built for device agnostic data collection and has many features that are designed to optimize the user experience such as address lookups, favorites for frequent selections, and PII detection based on Azure Cognitive Services leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI). Agencies will also have precise insight into how much time their users are spending in the app.

A rich set of built-in administrative features includes data submission functionality to the California Department of Justice. Agencies can conduct PII redaction and post-submission error correction directly in the application, with the reassurance of changes captured in an audit table.

This cloud-native solution is designed to run on serverless Azure Government cloud infrastructure with scalability, modern security, and the ability to integrate with modern analytics platforms. The maintenance burden is minimized because Agencies don't need to maintain on-site or even cloud hosted servers and the application can be available anywhere their users are without the need for mobile device management solutions. Code updates will be centrally managed and distributed.
