# Cal-RIPA

## By CSSA & Insight Digital Innovation

The CSSA RIPA Azure Marketplace offering is a cost effective, turnkey option for close to 700 law enforcement agencies in the State of California to effectively and transparently comply with the California Racial and Identity Profiling Act of 2015 (RIPA).

RIPA requires all state and local law enforcement agencies to collect data regarding stops of individuals, including perceived demographic information on persons stopped, and to report this data to the California Attorney General's Office. Every agency in California must comply by January 1st 2022.

The CSSA RIPA application is a complete solution to comply with this mandate. Itâ€™s a Progressive Web App (PWA) built for device agnostic data collection and has many features that are designed to optimize the user experience such as address lookups, favorites for frequent selections, and PII detection based on Azure Cognitive Services leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI). Agencies will also have precise insight into how much time their users are spending in the app.

A rich set of built-in administrative features includes data submission functionality to the California Department of Justice. Agencies can conduct PII redaction and post-submission error correction directly in the application, with the reassurance of changes captured in an audit table.

This cloud-native solution is designed to run on serverless Azure Government cloud infrastructure with scalability, modern security, and the ability to integrate with modern analytics platforms. The maintenance burden is minimized because Agencies don't need to maintain on-site or even cloud hosted servers and the application can be available anywhere their users are without the need for mobile device management solutions. Code updates will be centrally managed and distributed.

## Installing and configuring your RIPA application instance

### Required steps

1. Set up Authentication

   - First you should follow the [Create Authentication Scheme instructions](./Documentation/AUTHENTICATION.md) to create an Azure Active Directory OAuth/OpenID-Connect App Registration, Admin & User groups and the associated Roles.

2. Deploy App

   - Then go to the Azure US Government portal to install RIPA from your "Private" Marketplace offering. You can find detailed instruction here: [Azure Private Marketplace](./Documentation/MARKETPLACE.md)

3. Import CLEW Data

   - Once the app is deployed and can be logged into, it's time to set up the lookup lists for Schools, Cities and Offense Codes. Follow the [Domain Lists](./Documentation/DOMAIN-LISTS.md) instructions to import lookup lists.

4. Import Existing Users

   - Before users log in, you must import all existing RIPA users at your agency into the system if you are setting up a production environment. Go to [User Import](./Documentation/USER-IMPORT.md) for instructions about how to import existing RIPA users.

5. Set up sFTP credentials with DoJ

   - Before you submit stops from your system to CA DoJ you will have to get credentials. Go to [DoJ Configuration](./Documentation/DOJ-CONFIGURATION.md) for detailed instruction about how to set up your connection to the DoJ sFTP site.

6. Add users to AAD Groups
   - Add users to "RIPA-USERS" and/or "RIPA-ADMINS" groups in your Azure AD tenant. You may have used different group names when setting up. If you have existing user groups that you would rather use, you can do this mapping in the Azure AD Enterprise App Users and Groups setting. Note that group nesting is not supported.

### Optional steps

- Set up Beats: Follow the [Domain Lists](./Documentation/DOMAIN-LISTS.md) instructions as well as [Beats](./Documentation/BEATS.md.md)
- Set up Agency Questions: [Agency Questions](./Documentation/DOJ-CONFIGURATION.md)
- Set up Templates: [Templates](./Documentation/STOP-TEMPLATES.md). There is additional information about 2024 regulation testing templates here: [2024 Templates](./Documentation/2024-REGULATION-UPDATE-DOJ-TESTING.md)
